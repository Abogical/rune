# rune - symbolic execution for everyone

rune is a symbolic execution engine over ESIL. Integrated with radare2 for
your everyday use!

rune is extensible and customizable. Almost every component in rune
can have multiple implementations (each with their own tradeoffs) and still be
compatible with the existing system.

__Warning__: rune is under heavy development and the API is highly unstable.
However, feel free to use rune as any comments, suggestions and feedbacks are
highly valued at this stage of the project!
